FUNGAL: Flexible Unity Network-based Growth and Adaptive Learning

# F.U.N.G.A.L

F.U.N.G.A.L is a novel machine learning algorithm project inspired by the intricate network structures found in mycology. It aims to develop a learning algorithm that mimics the information processing and pattern recognition capabilities observed in mycological systems.

## Features

- Unique learning algorithm inspired by mycological network structures
- Adaptive architecture for effective pattern recognition and information processing
- Support for deep learning techniques and hierarchical feature extraction
- Seamless integration with popular machine learning libraries

## Data

The project requires labeled datasets for training and evaluation. You can use existing mycological datasets or create your own dataset specifically tailored for the algorithm.

## Contributing
